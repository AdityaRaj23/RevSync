# RevSync

I worked on this app as part of DevRev Forge Hackathon.

This project is a snap-in which helps Developer get reviews segregated, tagged and summarized in one streamlined way using Large Language Model(Mixtral-8x7b-instruct).

It auto tags customer's reviews on the basis of what is said in the reviews.

The summarization is summarized version of the review added to the Ticket when the ticket is created and tags are also associated with it.
